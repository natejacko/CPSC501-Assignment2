CPSC 501 - Assignment 2: Reflective Object Inspector

The following code base is for Assignment 2 offered in CPSC 501 by Jonathan Hudson at the University of Calgary.

The assignment description is as follows: The goal of this assignment is to create a reflective object inspector that does a complete introspection of
an object at runtime. The inspector will be implemented in a Java class called Inspector, and will be invoked using the method: public void inspect(Object obj, boolean recursive). This method will introspect on the object specified by the first parameter, printing what it finds to standard
output.
